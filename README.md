hello everynyan :3
how are you?
fine thank you!

welcome to my catfiles :3

this is a collection of configs from my systems that i actualy decided to customise.
majority of these configs are either custom that i made or something i found that i 
liked.

either way, everything should work as i do tend to spend more time configuring things
then actualy using the dammed thing anyways.


in this repository are some scripts that should help you install these configs.
some extra scripts exist too for custom applications that you can download and put
on path, aswell as my music playlists and the player that is used for said music.

## shells
my primary shell is xonsh but sometimes i use powershell for ps1 files
